1.Why cant we rely on CPU execution time to measure algorith effeciently?
 answer:

CPU execution time is not reliable for measuring algorithm efficiency because it is an absolute and inconsistent metric that is heavily influenced by external factors, rather than the algorithm's inherent design.
The main issues are:Hardware Dependency: The time varies greatly based on CPU speed, cache size, number of cores, and architecture.Environmental Factors: It is affected by the operating system's background tasks and what other programs are running concurrently.Inconsistency: Even on the same machine, running the algorithm multiple times can yield different results.

2. answer: O(1)

3. answer:

 a) O(n)

 b) O(n^2)

 c) O(logn)
